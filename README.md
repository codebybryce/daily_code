# Daily Code Snippets

Welcome to **Daily Code Snippets**! üöÄ

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning journal where I document and share a new piece of code I learn each day. Whether it's a useful **regex pattern**, a fundamental **JavaScript snippet**, or a handy **algorithm**, you'll find practical and reusable code here.

## What's Inside?

- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Common and advanced patterns for text processing.
- **JavaScript Essentials**: Snippets covering ES6+, DOM manipulation, and more.
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Useful implementations in JavaScript.
- **Miscellaneous Code Tips**: Any other programming-related insights I come across.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse, copy, and modify the code snippets for your own projects. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

## Stay Updated

I'll be updating this repository daily with new snippets, so be sure to **star** ‚≠ê this repo and check back often!
